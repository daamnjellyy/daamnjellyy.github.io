I currently work a full time job, but struggle with the thought that my position is so replaceable. This position I am currently blessed to have also helped me realize that I want to do so much more for myself. To be so much more, do so much more, and to be *irreplaceable*. 

I have always been intrigued with coding and understood computers and softwares more than my own work that I do on the daily basis. That is when I realized it's not too late for me to learn and become confident in a subject I love. 
I'm excited to learn, excited to grow, and excited for change.
